# ShipCube Tracking Policy

## 1. Tracking Overview
Tracking numbers are automatically generated and assigned once a shipment booking is confirmed.  
Customers can use the provided tracking ID to monitor the shipment’s journey from dispatch to final delivery.

## 2. How to Track Your Shipment
You can check the real-time status of your order through any of the following channels:
1. The ShipCube customer dashboard (available on web and mobile)
2. The ShipCube AI chatbot or by replying directly to shipment notification emails
3. SMS updates sent automatically at key transit stages

## 3. Tracking Status Stages
Shipments typically progress through the following status milestones:
- **Order Received:** Shipment booking confirmed and ready for dispatch.  
- **In Transit:** Package has been handed over to the courier and is moving through logistics hubs.  
- **Out for Delivery:** The package has reached the destination hub and is en route to the recipient.  
- **Delivered:** Delivery confirmed and marked as complete in the system.

## 4. Missing or Delayed Tracking Updates
If no tracking update is visible for more than **48 hours**, customers should contact the ShipCube support team at **support@shipcube.com**.  
The support team will investigate the courier’s system logs and provide an updated delivery estimate within 1–2 business days.

## 5. Sample Routes and Estimated Transit Times
For reference, average delivery durations for common routes are as follows:
- Delhi → Mumbai: 2–3 business days  
- Bengaluru → Chennai: 1–2 business days  
- Delhi → London: 6–8 business days

These times are estimates and may vary based on weather conditions, courier workload, or customs clearance processes.

## 6. Important Notes
- Tracking numbers become active within 12–24 hours after dispatch.  
- Some courier partners may show partial updates until the first hub scan.  
- International shipments may experience temporary tracking gaps during customs transfer.  
- Always verify the tracking number format if you cannot locate your order status online.
