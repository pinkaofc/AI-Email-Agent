                  SHIPCUBE SHIPMENT WORKFLOW
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This file documents the end-to-end shipment handling process used
internally at ShipCube. The AI system MUST follow these rules
when generating responses and MUST NOT invent workflow steps.

────────────────────
1. ORDER LIFECYCLE
────────────────────

1. Order Received
   - Customer places an order through integrated platforms.
   - Order is synced to ShipCube WMS (Logiwa).

2. Inventory Verification
   - Stock level is checked.
   - If insufficient inventory, the order is placed "On Hold - Awaiting Stock".

3. Picking
   - Picklists are generated automatically.
   - Items collected from warehouse shelves.

4. Packing
   - Items packed according to SOP.
   - Fragile items use additional cushioning.
   - Labels and barcodes added.

5. Quality Check
   - QC team verifies item correctness and quantity.
   - Damaged or incorrect items are flagged before dispatch.

6. Dispatch
   - Order handed over to courier partner (FedEx, UPS, DHL, USPS etc.)
   - Tracking ID generated by courier.
   - ShipCube NEVER modifies courier tracking IDs.

7. In Transit
   - Shipment travels through courier network.
   - ShipCube monitors status via API.

8. Destination Hub Arrival
   - Shipment arrives at final delivery hub for sorting.

9. Out for Delivery (OFD)
   - Courier delivers to final address.
   - If unsuccessful: Attempt 1 → Attempt 2 → Return to Origin (RTO).

10. Delivered
   - Courier marks order as delivered.
   - POD (Proof of Delivery) is stored by courier.

2. COMMON ISSUES AND ACTION PATHS
────────────────────

A. Missing Items / Short Shipment
   - Trigger: Customer reports missing cartons/items.
   - Action:
        • Check packing images.
        • Verify WMS picklist history.
        • Check outbound weight logs.
        • Coordinate with warehouse shift supervisor.
   - Response Rule: DO NOT confirm replacement unless operations approves.

B. Wrong Delivery / Incorrect Address
   - Trigger: Customer says shipment delivered elsewhere.
   - Action:
        • Validate with courier POD.
        • Request geolocation scan if available.
        • Raise escalation ticket.
   - AI MUST NOT provide exact location — only say “under verification”.

C. Delivery Delay
   - Trigger: No movement or delayed status.
   - Action:
        • Check courier scan history.
        • Verify if shipment is stuck at hub.
        • Check for weather or customs restriction.
   - Communication: Give SAFE timelines based on SLA rules (see SLA file).

D. Damaged Goods
   - Action:
        • Request photos.
        • Log QC claim.
        • Move to Damage Claim SLA process.

E. Customs Hold
   - Action:
        • Verify required documents.
        • Re-upload invoice/commercial documentation.
        • Coordinate with customs broker.

────────────────────
3. RULES THE AI MUST FOLLOW
────────────────────

• The AI MUST NEVER:
   - Invent tracking updates.
   - Claim “replacement sent”.
   - Confirm stock availability.
   - Promise exact delivery dates.
   - State internal warehouse locations.
   - Reveal partner-specific details not in KB.

• The AI MUST:
   - Use neutral, verification-based language.
   - Route issues requiring confirmation to Operations.
   - Refer to "our team" or "operations team" — not individuals.
